        <p>A block level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element</p>
        <p>A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can)</p>
        <p>Hello World</p> <!-- <p> is a block level element-->
        <div>Hello World</div> <!-- <div> is a block level element--><br>
        <p>An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as needed.</p>
        <p>Testing span tags <span>Hello World</span> Testing some more</p><br> <!-- <span> is an example of an inline element -->
        <p>The `div` element is often used as a container for other HTML elements and has no required attributes but `style`, `class` and `id` are common</p>
        <p>When used with CSS, the `dv` tag can be used to style block of content</p>
        <div style="background-color: black; color: white; padding: 20px;">
            <h2>London</h2>
            <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the united states</p>
        </div><br>
        <p>The`span` element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text or part of a document.</p>
        <p>The `span` element has no required attributes, but `style`, `class` and `id` are common</p>
        <p>My mother has <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"> blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color: darkgreen; font-weight: bold;">dark green</span> eyes</p>
